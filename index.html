                <h1 class="center headers cormorant-garamond bottom-border-thin">About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I grew up in the small town of Westfield New York, where after graduation from High School I
                    attended Jamestown Community College to obtain my Associates in Information Technology. After a
                    few years of realizing that I.T. isn't really for me, I spent some time becoming a decently successful
                    YouTube and Twitch partner where I created guides and gaming videos. During this time, I started working
                    towards a career of being a store manager at GameStop, but after some time I realized I wanted more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to accomplish something that could help me start a family and feel more fulfilling than just being 
                    a store manager, so I left GameStop to focus more on college to earn my bachelor's degree. Throughout my 
                    life I grew up around technology and because of this I am able to adapt quickly to new technology, software,
                    and game development platforms. With this knack I decided to attend Southern New Hampshire University Online
                    where simultaneously where I attended Full Time as I worked towards my chosen degree of Game Development and
                    Programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, throughout my time in college I had changed my mind between Game Development and Programming and 
                    Computer Science. However, I found a love for Game Development where I am able to use my creativity to explore
                    new and different ways to create immersive worlds that tell stories. For instance, I currently have 5 projects
                    with one, called Project Cyber, that I am working on as of this moment with a small team of people. Alongside
                    this I also came up with a 2D Sidescroller about a dream world, a roguelike FPS similar to Gunfire Reborn 
                    inspired by DnD, and a Survival series from a strange nightmare that I had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel that due to my idea creation, multitasking ability, hard work ethic, and management background I am a
                    great consideration for being part of a development team. I have discovered that I don't want to just be a
                    gamer, and I want to create amazing worlds with others that make people enjoy their time and be happy. Of
                    course I still feel wonderful and fulfilled just in general as a software engineer or game developer,
                    because I just love to program and I can't wait to see where it takes me.
