Patrick Reardon's Portfolio Website

This site is protected under the GPL-3.0 License which allows the fair use of my code on the site. However, Images identified via the attributes
document are owned by their respective authors which under fair use I am able to use for my portfolio. If one chooses to use the same images they
must follow Pixabay's copyright policy as well as follow the license attached to this portfolio. All Videos are owned by me and identify the work
I've done in a better format rather than just an image. My videos are protected under the GPL-3.0 License, but I do not give permission for others
to use my work or videos and identify it as their own.
